				<h1>Chris Spagnuolo</h1>
				<p>Hello, I'm Chris, a web and mobile app developer, located in Chicago. I love solving problems and learning new skills and technologies. I'm always trying to get better at what I do, both personally and professionally. In fact, I'm a bit of a personal development freak, but my motto is "If I'm not growing, I'm dying".</p>
				<p>Please, take a look around my site and get in touch if you are interested in working with me!</p>
